    Regional overview of layered sulfates assembled from morphology, mineralogy, and
    thermal inertia. The study area is centered on *75ºE, 15ºN*.

    Bedding orientations (95% CI in dip--dip azimuth space, using method from [@Quinn2017MethodLPSC]) measured on HiRISE
    stereo pair *ESP_021612_1975*/*ESP_021757_1975*. (**a**) Superposition
    of the Syrtis Major lavas atop a slope of layered sulfates and a dipping basement
    pediment. (**b**) Sulfates in the north part of the image dip southward beneath
    a flat lava flow. (**c**) In the southern part of the image, layered sulfates
    dip ~8º southwest beneath south-dipping lava flow, creating an angular unconformity.

    A model emplacement history for the layered sulfates, emphasizing the separability
    of sedimentation, volume-loss fracturing, and fluid alteration.
    The relative order of fracturing and lava flows is uncertain;
    volume-loss could occur in response to, or after,
    lava emplacement. In this alterative scenario, the panels *(2,3,4)* would be reordered *(3,2,4)*.
