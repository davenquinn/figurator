The stratigraphy at northeast Syrtis Major [Figure `fig:overview-map`] provides a unique
temporally-constrained record of changing hydrological conditions
during the Noachian–Hesperian transition on early Mars [@Ehlmann2012].
The stratigraphy, bracketed by the mid-Noachian Isidis Basin-forming impact
and mid-Hesperian Syrtis Major lavas [@Hiesinger2004], contains layered
sulfates superposed atop Noachian basement units altered to carbonates and clays.
The sulfate unit is recessive and layered at meter-scale, with some
areas containing boxwork polygonal ridges. It is capped by lava flows contiguous with the
Syrtis Major volcanic province.

The upward
progression from alkaline to acidic aqueous environments (and ultimately
to capping lavas with no evidence of pervasive alteration)
is characteristic of the planet's first billion years [e.g. @Bibring2006;@Murchie2009].
An understanding of the depositional environment and alteration history
of the layered sulfate unit can help trace the evolution of the early
Martian surface environment.
We assess detailed structural, mineralogical, and morphological observations
of the layered sulfates against a range of possible formation mechanisms (e.g. lava flow, ash fall,
lacustrine deposition).
The layered sulfates were likely deposited as
bedded sediments gently draping the Noachian basement, and underwent
diagenetic volume-loss fracturing and acid-sulfate alteration.

# A localized deposit
The extent of the layered sulfates is mapped using HiRISE, CTX, and HRSC
imagery and derived elevation models [Figure `fig:overview-map`].
Morphologic mapping is refined with CRISM mineral identifications and thermal inertia data.
Based on the elevation of bounding surfaces, the layered sulfates are up
to ~400 m thick, tapering laterally to the
northwest and southeast towards the edges of the study area.
<!--[[nf6-bedding]]-->This,
along with the lack of similar units elsewhere in Isidis Basin,
suggests localized deposition or preferential shielding from erosion
within the study area.

# Draping deposition

A new method for error analysis of bedding-orientation measurements [@Quinn2017MethodLPSC]
is used to interpret the depositional form of the layered sulfates. Dips
are <10º over the entire study area, but dip directions are variable,
with low angle changes in bedding evident at several-km scale. Dips
greater than ~5º often loosely correspond to dipping basement
paleotopography, suggesting deposition on a tilted surface.

Figure `fig:nf6-bedding` shows a stratigraphy with layered sulfates beneath the capping
Syrtis major lavas. Bedding orientations in the sulfate are consistent at ~4 km scale,
but change at the northern part of the image. In both areas, bedding is distinct
from the dip of the Syrtis Major lavas, showing a significant angular unconformity
that marks an erosional hiatus prior to lava emplacement.

# Volume-loss fracturing and alteration

Polygonal ridges at ~500 m scale (Figure `fig:overview-map`) are key markers
of alteration history of the layered sulfates.
These ridges dominantly intersect at right angles but
have no preferred orientation, and are often subvertical.
In some areas, localized bedding-orientation variability (up to ~5º) coincides
with boxwork domains.
These features are characteristic of volume-loss fracturing
without a regional stress field, analogous to 3D polygonal faulting
on Earth [@Goulty2008]. Dewatering of saturated sediments during diagenesis
is a likely model for fracture formation.

CRISM detections of jarosite along fracture traces, along with
isopachous fills visible from HiRISE imagery, show that these volume loss-fractures
were mineralized by acid-sulfate fluids. Variable penetration of fluids
leads to a wide range of fracture expression and erosional resistance.
Fracture fills grade into a bright-toned alteration
halo beneath the capping Syrtis Major lavas (Figure `fig:nf6-bedding`a),
underscoring the association of fluid mineralization with the overriding lava flows.

# Conclusion

The layered sulfates at northeast Syrtis major represent a significant sedimentary
package that was both deposited and significantly eroded during the Noachian--Hesperian
transition, prior to capping by Syrtis major lavas.
The sedimentary origin suggested
by the rhythmic bedding and recessive erosional character is confirmed by the
<!--[[sulfate-emplacement-history]]-->

flat to gently draping layering and pattern of volume-loss fracturing.
The regional
layering style and pattern of volume-loss fractures is characteristic of basinal deposition.
After deposition, the deposits underwent a multistage history of volume loss and
fluid mineralization. Overall, the layered sulfates show a significant presence of water at
the surface of Mars during the Noachian--Hesperian transition.
